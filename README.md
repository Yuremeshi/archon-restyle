Paste the code from user.css into a browser extension that allows you to load custom styles for specific sites.

Please note this is a very quick start to the project, and could break at any time if Archon updates the site, changes CSS selectors, etc.

I'd like to eventually work on a better customisation that allows Tank, Healer and DPS lists to appear on the same page.

PRs gladly accepted.
